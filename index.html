            <h1>About Me: </h1>
            <p> I am currently studying in Computer Science at Concordia University, specializing in Web Services
                and Applications. I have worked many years in construction at various locations, so I have experience
                communicating with other individuals and clients. It also shows that I have good work habits.
                I enjoy researching new technologies and improving myself with what I learn. I also have experience
                working in the field, such as doing an internship with Payment Rails where I made a website using
                WordPress and PHP, as well as testing out the security of their site using Java. On my own time, I
                have made various projects for myself, friends & family members which you can see below.
