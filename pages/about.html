            <h1>About Me: </h1>
            <p class="aboutparagraph"> I recently completed my studies at Concordia University titled Computer Science - Web Services & Technology.
                I have worked many years in construction at various locations, so I have experience communicating with other individuals and clients.
                I enjoy researching new technologies and improving myself with what I learn which is why I am able to adapt to new situations quickly.
                I also have experience working in the field, such as doing an internship with Payment Rails where I made a website using
                WordPress and PHP, as well as testing out the security of their site using Java. On my own time, I have made various projects for myself, 
                friends, acquaintances & family members which you can see in the <a href="projects.html">My Projects</a> section.
